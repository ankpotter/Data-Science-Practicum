# Data-Science-Practicum

The project was for Rochester Police Department. It involved trying to figure out at what stage of recruitment does the department lose most of its candidates and what is the demographics of the people dropping or failing at various stages of hiring.

All the python files were used for data preprocessing.
WEKA was used for association mining.
Report talks about everything done in the project.
